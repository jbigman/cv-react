        Dear Hiring Manager,
        <br/><br/>
        I am writing to apply for the position of Full Stack Developer at TapNation.
        <br/><br/>
        With over 10 years of experience in full stack development, I have acquired strong expertise in web and mobile development, focusing on NodeJs, ReactJs, and TypeScript, and have earned a Codingame certification with distinction. Confident in my ability to contribute to your team, I have employed web scraping techniques to enhance data for Gamewisher.com and collaborated with a designer to achieve high-quality UI/UX for LaPetitePouzerie.fr. These experiences align closely with the requirements of the position.
          
        <br/><br/>My passion for the gaming industry led me to create a dedicated YouTube channel and develop a mobile game search engine using NestJS and NextJS. I am particularly excited about the prospect of joining your innovative team.
          
        <br/> <br/>Managing a gaming community on Discord and thriving in an Agile environment over the years has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, communication, and adaptability. Having collaborated with product owners in English during my professional experience, I am confident in my ability to seamlessly integrate into your international team. Moreover, TapNation’s commitment to fostering employee growth and cohesion through events such as company trips, hackathons, and game jams resonates strongly with me and fuels my desire to contribute actively to your team’s success.
        
        <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my application.I look forward to discussing my projects in detail and illustrating how my skills can contribute to TapNation during an interview at your earliest convenience.
         
        <br/><br/>Best regards,
          
        <br/>Jérémie Gambin
